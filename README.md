# DragonFruit_Classification
 In this project, I developed a machine learning model using TensorFlow to classify dragon fruit images into different categories based on their features. The project involved building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately distinguish between various types of dragon fruit. The workflow included data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing. Techniques such as image augmentation were used to enhance model performance, achieving reliable and efficient classification. This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in agricultural and commercial domains.
