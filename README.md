# DragonFruit_Classification

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify dragon fruit images into distinct categories based on their features. Leveraging TensorFlow, the project demonstrates the power of deep learning in agriculture and commerce.

## Features
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A robust CNN architecture was designed and trained for accurate classification.
- **Image Augmentation:** Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to improve model generalization and performance.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** The project included data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing.
- **Practical Application:** Highlights the use of AI to address real-world problems in agriculture and commerce.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dragon fruit image dataset.
   - Applied normalization and resized images to standard dimensions.
2. **Image Augmentation:**
   - Enhanced the dataset with transformations to increase variety and robustness.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Built and trained a CNN using TensorFlow.
   - Utilized techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting.
4. **Validation and Testing:**
   - Evaluated model performance on validation and test datasets.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal results.

## Results
The model achieved reliable and efficient classification, demonstrating its capability to distinguish between different types of dragon fruit. Performance metrics and visualizations indicate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Technologies Used
